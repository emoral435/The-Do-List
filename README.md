# To Do List
This app is a personal test to see how I can replicate something that I use and adore every day.
A simple To-Do-List.
However, I believe that To Do Lists have the power to change the manner and direction that you live your life in. It gives you a better sense at what you truly prioritize in life.
Try it out! Thanks!
